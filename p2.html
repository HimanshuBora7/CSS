    <h2>Article 1</h2>
    <p>Pseudocode procedures appear on a tan background to make them easier to spot,
        and they do not necessarily appear on the page of their ûrst reference. When
        they don’t, the text directs you to the relevant page. In the same vein, nonlocal
        references to numbered equations, theorems, lemmas, and corollaries include
        the page number.</p>
    <h2>Article 2</h2>
    <p class="grey" id="second">
        We reviewed the entire book and rewrote sentences, paragraphs, and sections
        to make the writing <span class = "highlight">clearer</span>, more personal, and gender neutral. For example,
        the traveling-salesman problem= in the previous editions is now called the
        traveling-salesperson problem.= We believe that it is critically important for
        engineering and science, including our own ûeld of computer science, to be
        welcoming to everyone.
    </p>
    <h2>Article 3</h2>
    <p class="grey">
        We corrected <span class = "highlight">errors</span>, posting most corrections on our website of third-edition
errata. Those that were reported while we were in full swing preparing this
edition were not posted, but were corrected in this edition.
